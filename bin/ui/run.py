"""
plainkeep ui [args…] — the entry shim for the plainkeep terminal UI (proposal: the plainkeep.json/3 TUI).

The TUI ships as a SEPARATE binary (`plainkeep-ui`) that lives OUTSIDE this repo and drives plainkeep
purely over the machine contract (`plainkeep <verb> --json`, `plainkeep complete --json`,
`plainkeep help --json`). This shim just hands the terminal to it: it locates `plainkeep-ui` on PATH
(or via $PLAINKEEP_UI_BIN) and `execv`s it — it never re-resolves the `plainkeep` dispatcher, so there
is no recursion. When the binary isn't installed it prints a blocked-style, exact-remediation hint
(mirroring the setup-layer `status: blocked` / `next` pattern) and exits cleanly — a missing optional
frontend is not a crash. Risk `read` (launching a UI has no side effects of its own; every mutation
the UI performs still goes back through a gated `plainkeep` verb).
